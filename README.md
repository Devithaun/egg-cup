# 🥚 Egg Timer App

A simple Android app built using **Jetpack Compose** that helps users perfectly time their egg cooking process. Select how you want your egg cooked (e.g., soft-boiled or hard-boiled), and the app will count down, alerting you when the egg is ready. Includes a fun animated egg while the timer is running!

## 🎯 Features
- **Cooking Options**: Choose between soft-boiled, medium-boiled, or hard-boiled eggs.
